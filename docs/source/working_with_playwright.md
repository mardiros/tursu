# Working with playwright

TurÅŸu does not provide playwright option, but you can works with both
playwright and TurÅŸu for testing your web application.

Actually, it has been develop for that!

## Installation

```bash
uv add tursu pytest-playwright
uv run playwright install chromium
uv tursu init --no-dummies -o tests/functionals-playwright/
```

- playwright requires to download its own browsers,
  refer to the playwright documentation for more options.
- The `--no-dummies` does not create dummy scenario.

## Create a step

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/using_playwright/steps.py

```

That's it. You can just use the "Page" fixture provided by pytest-playwright directly.

## Create a scenario

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/using_playwright/01_basic.feature

```

## Run the test

```bash
uv run pytest --browser chromium -v tests/using_playwright/
```

Sure this tests will fail, this is BDD :)

## Adding a fixture

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/using_playwright/conftest.py

```

### Run the test

```bash
$ uv run pytest --browser chromium -v tests/using_playwright/
================================= test session starts =================================

```

## Use the trace artefact

While doing continuous integration, always activate the option
`--tracing retain-on-failure` from pytest-playright, it will generate a `trace.zip`
file in a `test-results` directory to configured as a build artefact.

Afterwhat you can see all step of the scenario using the show-trace command:

```bash
$ uv run playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

While running locally, you can stop on the first error and then show the trace.

```bash
$ rm -rf test-results
$ uv run pytest -sxv --tracing retain-on-failure tests/functionals
$ uv run playwright show-trace test-results/**/trace.zip
```

## Asyncio

pytest-playwright does not works well with pytest-asyncio, both plugins conflicts
on the asyncio loop, and in that case, the package
[pytest-playwright-asyncio](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-playwright-asyncio/)
shoud be used, and step definition has to be coroutine and the scenario decorated
manually with a [@asyncio](#using-tags-asyncio) tag.

This is the subject of the [next chapter](#playwright-asyncio).
