This project allows you to write **Gherkin**-based behavior-driven development (BDD) tests
and execute them using **pytest**.

It compiles Gherkin syntax into Python code using **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** manipulation,
enabling seamless integration with pytest for running your tests.

Enjoy practicing BDD in **modern Python** (3.10+), type hinting, asyncio, dataclasses or Pydantic,
pytest, playwright.

## Features

- Write tests using **Gherkin syntax**.
- Write **step definitions** in Python for with type hinting to cast Gherkin parameters.
- Execute tests directly with **pytest**.
- Compile Gherkin scenarios to Python code using **AST**.

## Getting started

### Installation using uv

```bash
uv add --group dev tursu
```

### Creating a new test suite

The simplest way to initialize a test suite is to run the Turşu cli.

```
uv run tursu init
```

### Discover your tests.

If --trace is used, the tests files are written on the disk, and
the `???` in the context are replaced by the generated python test function.

This may be usefull in case of hard time debugging.

### Great support of playwright.

Combining Turşu and [pytest-playwright](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-playwright/)
is a great experience.
See the [example in the documentation](https://mardiros.github.io/tursu/working_with_playwright.html)

### Great support of asyncio.

Turşu can also be combined with [pytest-playwright-asyncio](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-playwright-asyncio/)
and run tests has coroutine using [pytest-asyncio](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-asyncio/).

Scenario can be decorated with a `@asyncio` tag. And they will run as a
coroutine marked with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.

And, the step definitions can be coroutine.

See the [pytest-playwright-asyncio example in the documentation](https://mardiros.github.io/tursu/working_with_playwright_async.html)

### Great support of pytest fixtures and faker.

See the [example in the documentation](https://mardiros.github.io/tursu/working_with_fixtures.html)

### All Gherkin features are support.

Turşu use the [gherkin-official](https://pypi.org/project/gherkin-official/)
package to parse Gherkin Scenario beeing compiled to python.

- ✅ Feature _(converted to python module)_
- ✅ Scenario _(converted to debuggable python test function or coroutine)_
- ✅ Scenario Outlines / Examples _(converted to @pytest.mark.parametrize test function or coroutine)_
- ✅ Background _(Step copied to all the functions of the scenario)_
- ✅ Rule _(tags converted to pytest marker)_
- ✅ Steps _(Given, When, Then, And, But, bound to the [step definition](https://mardiros.github.io/tursu/step_definition.html) provided.)_
- ✅ Tags _([converted to pytest marker](https://mardiros.github.io/tursu/using_tags.html) on Feature, Scenario, Scenario Outline and Rule)_
- ✅ Doc String _(support casting of json to [python model with the lib of your choice: pydantic, dataclasses,...](https://mardiros.github.io/tursu/advanced_docstring.html))_
- ✅ Data Table _(support casting to [python model with the lib of your choice](https://mardiros.github.io/tursu/advanced_datatable.html))_
